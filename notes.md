I'll analyze this resume from the perspective of big tech companies' hiring standards. Here's a detailed critique:
Strengths:

Strong technical breadth across multiple domains (MLOps, Data Engineering, Full-stack)
Clear quantitative impact metrics in job descriptions (e.g., "reducing upload errors by 40%", "improving processing time by 50%")
Good demonstration of scalability experience with systems handling millions of users
Strong educational background with relevant TA experience
Interesting technical projects showing initiative and complexity

Areas for Improvement:

Professional Summary:
Too generic and lacks specificity about core strengths
Should highlight specific achievements or specialized expertise that sets them apart
Missing mention of scale/impact of systems worked on

Technical Skills:
List is too broad and unfocused for big tech
Should prioritize/group skills by proficiency level
Missing popular big tech frameworks like React/Angular (showing mostly Svelte/Flutter)
Should highlight deep expertise in core languages rather than listing many

Experience Section:
Recent positions are relatively short-term (< 1 year at Loopn AI)
Startup experience is good but lacks big company experience that tech giants often prefer
Some achievements could be more specific:

"Built a 3D web viewer" - should include user impact metrics
"Improved processing time by 50%" - should specify the scale (how many requests/day?)

Projects Section:
Projects are interesting but lack links to code/demos
Should highlight collaborative aspects and team size for each project
Missing specific technologies used in each project
Beer Stock Exchange project needs more technical detail about architecture/scale

Education:
Could highlight relevant coursework for desired roles
Missing GPA if it's impressive
Could expand on research projects if any

Format and Structure:
Resume is quite dense and could benefit from better visual hierarchy
Technical achievements could be better organized by themes (scalability, performance, architecture)

Recommendations for Big Tech Applications:

Tailor for Specific Roles:
Create versions focusing on either MLOps, Backend, or Full-stack
Highlight relevant projects and experience for each role type

Add System Design Details:
Include architecture decisions and trade-offs made
Mention specific performance optimizations
Add scale metrics for systems built

Strengthen Leadership Examples:
Add more details about team leadership at Loopn AI
Include team sizes and cross-functional collaboration examples

Technical Depth:
Focus on demonstrating depth in key technologies rather than breadth
Add complexity metrics for projects (e.g., lines of code, traffic handled)
Include examples of difficult technical problems solved

Cultural Fit:
Add examples of data-driven decision making
Include instances of mentoring/teaching others
Demonstrate impact beyond immediate role

The resume shows strong technical capabilities but needs refinement to better align with big tech expectations. The focus should shift from breadth to depth in key areas, with more emphasis on scale, impact, and specific technical challenges overcome.


HIGH PRIORITY (Critical Changes):

Focus Role Targeting
Choose ONE primary role (MLOps Engineer seems most aligned with recent experience)
Remove the triple-slash title and commit to MLOps specialization
Reframe the professional summary to emphasize MLOps expertise specifically

Quantify System Scale & Impact
Add clear metrics for ML systems managed (e.g., number of models in production)
Include throughput/performance metrics (requests/day, data volume)
Specify team sizes and project scope for leadership experience
Example improvement:
From: "Engineered an ML pipeline for 3D reconstructions"
To: "Engineered ML pipeline processing 10K+ 3D reconstructions/month, managing 5 production models with 99.9% uptime"

Deepen Technical Details
Add architecture diagrams or descriptions for key systems
Specify ML frameworks and model types worked with
Include specific challenges solved in ML deployment
Detail monitoring and observability solutions implemented

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

Experience Section Restructuring
Lead with technical complexity rather than chronological details
Highlight cross-functional collaboration examples
Add more MLOps-specific achievements from each role
Remove or minimize non-MLOps responsibilities

Skills Section Refinement
Create tiered grouping: Expert, Proficient, Familiar
Prioritize MLOps-relevant technologies
Remove or downplay less relevant skills (e.g., front-end technologies)
Add specific versions/implementations used

Project Section Enhancement
Add GitHub links for relevant projects
Focus on MLOps-related projects
Include scale and performance metrics
Detail ML infrastructure decisions and outcomes

LOWER PRIORITY:

Education Section
Add relevant coursework in ML/distributed systems
Highlight any ML-related research or projects
Include GPA if above 3.5

Format and Organization
Create more white space for readability
Use consistent formatting for metrics and numbers
Add section for ML publications/presentations if any

Additional Elements
Consider adding a "Technical Challenges Solved" section
Include MLOps certifications if any
Add section for ML community contributions

Language and Presentation
Use more ML-specific technical terminology
Ensure consistency in technical descriptions
Add links to technical blogs/presentations if available

This prioritized approach focuses on:
First establishing clear role focus
Then demonstrating quantifiable impact
Following with technical depth
Finally polishing presentation and supporting elements
